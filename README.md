# QR - Analysis 

This is the instructor-facing repository for the class schedule and assignments for the 
QR-A core course at the University of Austin in Winter term, 2026.

1. Reading questions are in the textbook site: QR-A. The documents are distributed 
from the QR-A textbook website.

2. Almost all exercises are in the textbook site, BUT the day-to-day assignments are 
written here. 

    a. This generally involves using Quarto shortcodes to INCLUDE the files 
from the textbook site.
    b. Images that go with the book or exercises are *symbolically linked* to this repository. They are 
in the www directory. 
    c. Each time the repo is installed on an instructor computer, install in the **same parent
user directory** the QR-A book repo. Then make a symbolic link from the QR-A/www directory to
www in this directory. The terminal command should be given from the QRA-homepage directory. Use the command `ls -l ../QR-A/www www`
    
3. In an instance of bad practice, the _start-up.R file and _software/ directory were
*manually copied over*. Tell Danny to fixe this.
